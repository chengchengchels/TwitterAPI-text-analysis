# TwitterAPI-text-analysis

Initially the code was to display a way to generate key words in an example of economic news(I also tried 'blockchain') in #USA, #ASIA and #EU from Tweets, 
I modified the code minimally to generate a correlogram showing the key words from music-related feeds with hashtag 
ALANWALKER, JUSTINBIEBER and MARSHMELLO. 

The quality and relevance of the result largely depend on the quantity of tweets existing then containing the selected hashtags.
I also added a few custom stop words to make the results look more clean.

I then replaced ALANWALKER with AVICII,suprisingly alanwalker still appeared in the result. I also spotted 'fortnite' which subsequently 
lead me to search and find about Marshmello's Fortnite concert and the awesome album 'Marshmello Fortnite Extended Set' on apple music!
This result can be seen in the picture in this repository, which is time-based and will be different as more tweets enter into the database as time goes by.

This is a simple tool that a twitter user can play with to find 'big news' in the area of interest.
