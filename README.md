# TwitterAPI-text-analysis

Initially the code was to display a way to generate key words in an example of economic news in #USA, #ASIA and #EU from Tweets, 
I modified the code minimally to generate a correlogram showing the key words from music-related feeds with hashtag 
ALANWALKER, JUSTINBIEBER and MARSHMELLO. 

The quality and relevance of the result largely depend on the quantity of tweets existing then containing the selected hashtags.

I then replaced ALANWALKER with AVICII,suprisingly alanwalker still appeared in the result. I also spotted 'fortnite' which subsequently 
lead me to search and find about Marshmello's Fortnite concert and the awesome album 'Marshmello Fortnite Extended Set' on apple music!

This is a simple tool that a twitter user can play with to find 'big news' in the area of interest.
